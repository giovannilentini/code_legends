# Code Legends

Welcome to **Code Legends**, a Ruby on Rails application where users can challenge each other in coding duels. Each match generates a random challenge from a pool of existing challenges in the database, allowing users to test their coding skills in real-time. Additionally, users can connect, send friend requests, and challenge their friends to duels!
